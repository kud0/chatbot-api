In the left sidebar:
1. Click **"WhatsApp"** to expand
2. Click **"API Setup"**

### 4.2 View Test Number

You'll see a section: **"From" dropdown**

This shows your **test phone number**:
```
+1 555-XXX-XXXX (this is Meta's test number)
```

**Important:** This is NOT your number. This is Meta's test number that will send messages on your behalf.

### 4.3 Get Phone Number ID

Under the phone number dropdown, you'll see:

**Phone number ID:** `123456789012345`

**üìù COPY THIS** - You'll need it later!

```
WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=123456789012345
```

Save this in a text file for now.

---

## Step 5: Get Your Access Token (3 minutes)

### 5.1 Find Access Token Section

On the same "API Setup" page, scroll down to:

**"Temporary access token"**

You'll see a token like:
```
EAABsbCS1iHgBOZC8za...  (very long string)
```

### 5.2 Copy Token

1. Click the **"Copy"** button next to the token
2. **üìù SAVE THIS** to your text file

```
WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN=EAABsbCS1iHgBOZC8za...
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:**
- This is a **temporary token** (24-72 hours)
- For testing only
- We'll get a permanent token later
- Keep this SECRET (never share publicly)

---

## Step 6: Add Your Test Phone Number (5 minutes)

### 6.1 Add Test Recipient

On the "API Setup" page, find:

**"To" section** (Send and receive messages)

You'll see:
```
To: [Manage phone number list]
```

Click **"Manage phone number list"**

### 6.2 Add Your Phone

1. Click **"Add phone number"** button
2. Enter YOUR personal phone number
   - Country code + number
   - Example: `+34 612 345 678` (Spain)
   - Example: `+1 555 123 4567` (USA)
3. Click **"Send code"**

### 6.3 Verify Your Phone

1. **Check WhatsApp** on your phone
2. You'll receive a message from WhatsApp
3. It contains a **6-digit code**
4. Enter the code in the Meta dashboard
5. Click **"Verify"**

**‚úÖ Your phone is now verified!**

You can now receive test messages on this number.

---

## Step 7: Send a Test Message (2 minutes)

Let's verify everything works!

### 7.1 Send Test from Dashboard

On the "API Setup" page:

1. **From:** (should show your test number)
2. **To:** (select your verified phone number)
3. **Message:** Click **"Send message"** button

### 7.2 Check Your Phone

**Open WhatsApp on your phone**

You should see a message from:
```
+1 555-XXX-XXXX
Hello World!
```

**‚úÖ If you received it, WhatsApp is working!**

---

## Step 8: Configure Webhook (LATER - After Deployment)

**‚ö†Ô∏è SKIP THIS FOR NOW**

We'll do this AFTER deploying to Vercel. For now, just understand:

- Webhook = URL where WhatsApp sends incoming messages
- Format: `https://your-app.vercel.app/api/webhook/whatsapp`
- We'll set this up in Step 10

---

## Step 9: Create Webhook Verify Token (1 minute)

You need to create a secret password for webhook verification.

### 9.1 Generate a Random String

**Option A:** Use your own
```
my_super_secret_webhook_token_12345
```

**Option B:** Generate random (recommended)
```bash
# On Mac/Linux terminal:
openssl rand -base64 32

# Or use this online:
# https://passwordsgenerator.net/
# Settings: 32 characters, letters + numbers
```

### 9.2 Save It

**üìù COPY AND SAVE:**
```
WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_generated_secret_here
```

Add to your text file with other credentials.

---

## Step 10: Get Permanent Access Token (Optional - Production Only)

**‚ö†Ô∏è SKIP FOR NOW - Only for production**

The temporary token expires. For production, you'll need a permanent token.

### Later Steps (after testing):

1. Create a **System User** in Business Settings
2. Generate a **permanent token**
3. Assign appropriate permissions

For now, the temporary token is fine for testing!

---

## Summary - What You Should Have Now

**üìù Your credentials (save these):**

```bash
# WhatsApp Configuration
WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID=123456789012345  # From Step 4
WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN=EAABsbCS1iHgBO...   # From Step 5
WHATSAPP_WEBHOOK_SECRET=my_secret_token   # From Step 9

# Test Phone
Your personal phone: +34 612 345 678       # From Step 6 (verified)
```

---

## Next Steps

Now that WhatsApp is set up, you need:

1. ‚úÖ WhatsApp credentials (DONE!)
2. ‚è≥ xAI API key (Next)
3. ‚è≥ Google Calendar setup (After xAI)
4. ‚è≥ Deploy to Vercel (Final step)
